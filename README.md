# Web3DModelling
This is from the time I fiddled with blender and using three.js
The test.html has no lights and no textures, but yopu can see the X-wing I made in blender next to the objects made with three.js, the index.html uses 3 different lights, all of them are commentable out so you can only see one, but sadly the x-wing is not present :/
